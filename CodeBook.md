=================================================	

1.	First variable "activity" comes from merged y_train.txt and y_test.txt.
	Every number is replaced with corresponding label according to file activity_labels.txt.
	This variable represents activity under which measurements are made.
	There are six different activities:
		> WALKING
		> WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		> WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		> SITTING
		> STANDING
		> LAYING

2.	Second variable "subejct" is the ID of the subject who took measurements.
	These values are in subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt.
	Values are in range 1 to 30.
	
3.	All other variables come from merged X_train.txt and X_test.txt.
	These variables are summarized by group determined with first two variables and mean function.
	
=================================================	
	
There are seven steps in run_analysis.R script:

1.	Reading X_train, y_train and subject_train from files and performing cbind
2.	Reading X_test, y_test and subject_test from files and performing cbind
3.	rbind-ing test and train data into allData and labeling columns according to features.txt
4.	Replacing numbers in activity column with activity labels according to activity_labels.txt.
5.	Selecting only "mean" and "std" variables from the original data
6.	Grouping and summarazing data using dplyr package
7.	Remove auxiliary variables from R environment
